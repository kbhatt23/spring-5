Troubleshooting Tip #3 - Command-Line Option
Steps to free port which is already used to run Tomcat server in Eclipse
For example , suppose 8080 port is used , we need to make free 8080 to run tomcat

Step 1: (open the CMD command)

C:\Users\username>netstat -o -n -a | findstr 0.0:8080

TCP    0.0.0.0:3000      0.0.0.0:0              LISTENING       3116

Now , we can see that LISTENING port is 3116 for 8080 ,

We need to kill 3116 now

Step 2:
C:\Users\username>taskkill /F /PID 3116

Step 3:  Return back to Eclipse and start the Tomcat Server, it should start up now.

STEPS TO DEPLOY WAR ON TOMCAR

1. In Eclipse, stop Tomcat
2. Right-click your project and select Export > WAR File
3. In the Destination field, enter: <any-directory>/mycoolapp.war
4. Outside of Eclipse, start Tomcat
- If you are using MS Windows, then you should find it on the Start menu
5. Make sure Tomcat is up and running by visiting: http://localhost:8080
6. Deploy your new WAR file by copying it to <tomcat-install-directory>\webapps
Give it about 10-15 seconds to make the deployment. You'll know the deployment is over because you'll see a new folder created in webapps ... with your WAR file name.

7. Visit your new app. If your war file was: mycoolapp.war then you can access it with:  http://localhost:8080/mycoolapp/
