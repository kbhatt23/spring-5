Troubleshooting Tip #3 - Command-Line Option
Steps to free port which is already used to run Tomcat server in Eclipse
For example , suppose 8080 port is used , we need to make free 8080 to run tomcat

Step 1: (open the CMD command)

C:\Users\username>netstat -o -n -a | findstr 0.0:8080

TCP    0.0.0.0:3000      0.0.0.0:0              LISTENING       3116

Now , we can see that LISTENING port is 3116 for 8080 ,

We need to kill 3116 now

Step 2:
C:\Users\username>taskkill /F /PID 3116

Step 3:  Return back to Eclipse and start the Tomcat Server, it should start up now.
